(ns collect-gleif-golden-copy
  "Bulk ingest of the GLEIF LEI-CDF v3.1 Golden Copy (full file, ~3.4M legal
   entities) into the portable EDN corpus this workspace queries with Datalog.

   Why a bulk file and not the paginated API: `scripts/collect_gleif.cljs` walks
   https://api.gleif.org/api/v1 at 200 records per request. The LEI universe is
   >3.3M records, i.e. >16k requests for one refresh — that is not an ingest
   path, it is a lookup path. GLEIF publishes the same data as a daily Golden
   Copy file under the same licence (CC0), which is the supported way to obtain
   the whole universe.

   Coverage gate: this collector goes through `coverage/assert-collectable!` on
   the same GLOBAL/GLEIF authority entry as the API collector, so it fails
   closed if that entry ever stops being :allow-login-free.

   Output is newline-delimited EDN (one map per line), NOT a single EDN vector:
   at this record count a whole-file `read-string` is not workable, and the
   query plane's `slurp-edn-lines` reader already expects this shape.

   The corpus is a cache artifact, not a git artifact (~850 MB) — see
   `--out` default and DATA-GOVERNANCE.md. Commit the *projections* built from
   it by `scripts/project_gleif_corpus.cljs`, not the corpus.

   `--skip`/`--limit` make the ingest shardable. Parsing a row costs ~1.2 ms of
   ClojureScript and skipping one costs a regex, so N shards over disjoint row
   ranges finish in ~1/N of the time and concatenate, in order, into the same
   corpus — worth it on a loaded machine where one process gets a fraction of a
   core. Only shard 0 writes the manifest line.

     nbb scripts/collect_gleif_golden_copy.cljs --zip <path> --out <corpus.edn> --limit 1000
