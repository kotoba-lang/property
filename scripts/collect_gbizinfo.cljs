  "gBizINFO の法人活動情報を、**この面が既に持っている法人番号**に対して引く。

   One request per company per aspect, so the allowlist is the cost: 8,124
   numbers × 3 aspects is 24k requests, which is a real pass and needs the
   operator's own token in `GBIZINFO_TOKEN`.

   `--demo` uses the token the public OpenAPI document publishes for 動作確認
   and **caps the run at `--max-requests` (default 120)**. That cap is the
   point: a verification that could silently become a bulk pass on a shared
   token is not a verification.

   Token acquisition (owner action, ~2 minutes, self-serve):
