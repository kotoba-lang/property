(ns collect-jgrants
  "jGrants (デジタル庁) の公開 API から補助金の**公募**カタログを集める。

   The API needs no key and no account, but it also has no enumeration: a
   `keyword` of 2+ characters is required (an empty one is HTTP 400), so this
   unions a keyword set and records which keywords produced the result. The
   detail endpoint is one request per programme, so it is fetched only for
   programmes whose window is currently open.

   Output is the committed artifact directly — the whole catalogue is a few
   thousand records, which is small enough that a corpus/projection split would
   be ceremony rather than protection.

   Usage:
     nbb -cp src scripts/collect_jgrants.cljs --out data/jgrants-catalog.datoms.edn
     nbb -cp src scripts/collect_jgrants.cljs --out /tmp/j.edn --keywords 事業,補助 --no-detail"
