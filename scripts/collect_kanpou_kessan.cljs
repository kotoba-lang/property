  "官報の会社決算公告から非上場企業の決算期を集める。

   The only public route to 決算期 for a company that files no securities
   report — and it is a *window*, not an archive: kanpou.npb.go.jp serves the
   last 90 days free and nothing before that. So this is data you start
   accumulating, and a day not collected is a day lost.

   Yield is reported, not hidden: the summary prints how many 決算公告 headlines
   were found and how many became records. A parser that quietly dropped two
   thirds of them would look identical to a quiet day.

   Requires `pdftotext` (poppler). Fails closed if it is missing rather than
   writing an empty file.

   Usage:
     nbb -cp src scripts/collect_kanpou_kessan.cljs --dates 20260818,20260817 --out /tmp/k.edn
     nbb -cp src scripts/collect_kanpou_kessan.cljs --back 7 --out <repo>/data/kanpou-kessan.datoms.edn"
