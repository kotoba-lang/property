(ns tally-gleif-universe
  "GLEIF corpus (cache, ~3.4M records) -> the committed universe denominator.

   Answers the one question a projection cannot: how many legal entities does
   GLEIF's Golden Copy actually hold, by jurisdiction and by registration
   status. `data/gleif-lei-joined.datoms.edn` holds 18,930 companies because
   that is the slice the query plane references — reading that as a world
   count is the error this script exists to make impossible.

   Streams the corpus line by line: it is larger than this process's heap.
   Output is a single small EDN map, committable to a private projections repo;
   the corpus itself stays in `~/.cache/gleif` and is never committed.

   Usage:
     nbb -cp src scripts/tally_gleif_universe.cljs \\
       --corpus ~/.cache/gleif/gleif-lei-corpus-20260825.edn \\
       --out data/gleif-universe-denominator.edn \\
       --declared-record-count 3411119

   Exit codes are three-valued on purpose (CLAUDE.md, 2026-08-13): 0 measured,
   1 measured and something was wrong, 3 could not measure. A run that scanned
   nothing must not be able to return the same value as a run that scanned
   everything and found nothing unusual."
