(ns project-invoice-corpus
  "Invoice-registry corpus -> committed projection for the query plane.

   The join-driven default is `--number-file`: the 法人番号 the plane already
   carries, so the projection answers \"is this counterparty a registered
   invoice issuer, since when, and is the registration still live\" for exactly
   the companies a query can reach.

   Individuals are refused, not filtered: `invoice-zenken/projectable?` decides,
   and a refusal is counted and reported rather than quietly dropped. A
   projection that silently omitted them would look the same as one built from
   a corpus that never had them.

   Usage:
     nbb -cp src scripts/project_invoice_corpus.cljs --corpus <c> \\
       --number-file /tmp/plane-jp-numbers.txt --latest-only \\
       --out <repo>/data/invoice-joined.datoms.edn"
