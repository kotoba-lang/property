(ns project-houjin-bangou-corpus
  "法人番号 corpus (cache, ~5.8M rows) -> committed projection for the query plane.

   Usage:
     nbb -cp src scripts/project_houjin_bangou_corpus.cljs \\
       --corpus ~/.cache/houjin-bangou/houjin-bangou-corpus.edn \\
       --name-file /tmp/plane-jp-names.txt \\
       --report /tmp/name-resolution.edn \\
       --out data/houjin-bangou-joined.datoms.edn

     nbb -cp src scripts/project_houjin_bangou_corpus.cljs --corpus <c> \\
       --prefecture JP-13 --kind 301 --latest-only --active-only \\
       --out data/houjin-bangou-tokyo.datoms.edn

   Streams the corpus line by line: it is larger than this process's heap.

   Name resolution runs in a second phase, after the scan, because deciding
   whether a name is ambiguous needs to have seen every candidate. Only names
   that resolve to exactly one entity are written; the rest are reported by
   name in `--report` and are NOT in the projection."
