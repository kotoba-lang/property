(ns link-kanpou-numbers
  "官報決算公告のレコードに法人番号を付ける。

   The notices carry a name and an address and no 法人番号, so the link is name
   resolution against the corporate registry — which
   `project_houjin_bangou_corpus.cljs --name-file --report` already performs,
   including refusing to resolve a name that two companies share.

   This step only *applies* that report. It never guesses: a record whose name
   was ambiguous or unmatched keeps its name and gets no number, and both counts
   are printed. Silently dropping them would make the dataset look smaller and
   cleaner than it is; silently picking one would make it wrong.

   Usage:
     nbb -cp src scripts/link_kanpou_numbers.cljs \\
       --records /tmp/kanpou-14d.edn --report /tmp/kanpou-resolution.edn \\
       --out <repo>/data/kanpou-kessan.datoms.edn"
