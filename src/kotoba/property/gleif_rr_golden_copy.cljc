  "Portable parsing/normalisation for the GLEIF RR (Level 2) Golden Copy CSV.

   Level 1 (`kotoba.property.gleif-golden-copy`) says who a legal entity is.
   Level 2 says who owns it. The two files are published together under the
   same CC0 terms, and only the second one answers 'who ultimately controls
   this counterparty' — the question a Level 1 projection structurally cannot
   reach, because an entity record carries no edge.

   Kept free of I/O for the same reason as its Level 1 sibling: the row
   contract must be testable without a 240 MB download. The CSV mechanics
   (`row->cells`, `header-index`, `record-start?`) are shared rather than
   re-implemented — an RR row opens with a 20-character LEI exactly like a
   LEI2 row, so the same record-start test holds.

   The emitted attribute names are the ones `scripts/query_corporate_parent.cljs`
   already queries from the paginated-API collector
   (`:corporate-relation/child-lei`, `-parent-lei`, `-type`). Bulk and API
   paths must stay interchangeable for the same reason `api-record->record`
   exists on Level 1: a relationship spelled one way from the bulk file and
   another way from the API would split into two answers to one question.

   Measured on the 20260803-0000 publish (483,263 relationships):

     IS_FUND-MANAGED_BY            148,759
