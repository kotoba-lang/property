(ns kotoba.property.houjin-bangou-projection
  "Select a bounded slice of the 法人番号 corpus for the workspace query plane,
   and resolve company *names* to corporate numbers honestly.

   Why a projection exists at all: the corpus is 5.8M rows / ~5.1M live
   entities. On this workspace's DataScript loader a million entities cost
   ~5.6 GB and ~156 s (measured for GLEIF, `org-gleif-projections/README.md`),
   so the whole registry is not a price a CLI query can pay. The corpus stays
   whole on disk; the plane loads the slice a question needs.

   What that costs, stated plainly (CLAUDE.md, kotobase one-ref rule): a
   corporate number outside the loaded slice does NOT join to GLEIF,
   market-intel or cloud-itonami-lei in Datalog. It is answerable only by a
   scan of the corpus (`scripts/query_houjin_bangou_corpus.cljs`), which
   cannot join. Widening the join surface means widening the projection, not
   sharding it further.

   ## Name resolution is where this dataset is easy to lie with

   A JP company name is not a key. `normalize-name` is exact enough to trust;
   `name-core` (form-insensitive) is not, because 株式会社A and 有限会社A share
   a core, as do a parent and its 100%-owned namesake. So the resolver keeps
   three outcomes apart and never collapses them:

     :exact      — one record whose normalized name equals the query
     :core       — no exact hit, exactly one form-insensitive hit
     :ambiguous  — more than one hit at whichever level answered

   An ambiguous name resolves to NOTHING and is reported by name. Picking the
   first candidate would produce a projection that looks complete and is
   quietly wrong about which company it is."
