  "Portable record shapes for gBizINFO (Gビズインフォ, 経済産業省) — the REST API
   that answers, per 法人番号, **what the state has given, bought and recorded**:
   補助金交付, 調達, 財務, 届出・認定・表彰.

   ## Why this is join-driven and not an ingest

   Everything here keys on 法人番号, which this workspace already has as
   `:company/houjin-bangou`. So the useful unit is not \"the universe\" but
   \"the companies the plane already carries\": one request per company per
   aspect, bounded by the projection we already committed.

   That is also the honest boundary against jGrants, which sits next to it:
   jGrants is the 公募 side (which subsidies exist), this is the 交付 side (who
   received one). Neither implies the other.

   ## What it does NOT replace

   gBizINFO is itself an aggregator of ministry data. Reading it is the cheap
   path to 交付実績 and 財務; it is not independence from it. Anything this
   workspace wants to keep if gBizINFO changes has to be archived when it is
   read — the same rule the NTA archives dataset exists for.
