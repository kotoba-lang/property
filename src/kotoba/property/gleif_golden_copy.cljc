  "Portable parsing/normalisation for the GLEIF LEI-CDF v3.1 Golden Copy CSV.

   Kept free of I/O so the row contract can be tested without a 474 MB
   download: `scripts/collect_gleif_golden_copy.cljs` owns the streaming and
   this namespace owns the meaning of a row.

   The emitted attribute names are deliberately the ones the workspace query
   plane already joins on (`:company/lei`, `:company/legal-name`,
   `:company/jurisdiction`) so that a GLEIF record and a market-intel or
   cloud-itonami-lei record unify on `:company/lei` without a translation
   layer. See ADR-2607252000 (unified query plane, cross-repo company join).

   Corpus shape: line 1 is a manifest map carrying the provenance that is
   constant for the whole file (authority, licence, publish, source hash);
   every later line is one company. Repeating those five values on 3.4M
   records cost ~680 MB of the corpus and a measurable share of the ingest's
   `pr-str` time, for information that cannot vary within a file."
