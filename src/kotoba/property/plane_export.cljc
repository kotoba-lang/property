  "Turn collected stores into the newline-EDN corpora the workspace query plane
   loads (see `manifest/edn-query.cljs` in the superproject).

   Two shapes exist in this repo and they are not interchangeable:

   - `var/` holds a collector's *working store*: a single EDN map keyed by
     record id, rewritten in place on every refresh, and git-ignored. It is a
     cache, not a publication.
   - `data/` holds a *published projection*: newline-EDN, one record per line,
     committed, and readable by anything that can read EDN lines without
     holding the whole file in memory.

   Only projections that pass the publication review in DATA-GOVERNANCE.md may
   be written to `data/` — today that is public-body property claims and
   corporate identity records, neither of which contains natural-person data."
