  "Portable record shape for jGrants — デジタル庁's public subsidy portal API
   (`api.jgrants-portal.go.jp`, no key, no account).

   ## What this dataset is, and what it is not

   It is the **公募** catalogue: which subsidy programmes exist, who runs them,
   what they cap, which prefecture and headcount they target, and when the
   window closes. It is **not** 交付実績 — the API says nothing about which
   company received which grant, and no attribute here joins to 法人番号.

   That distinction matters because the obvious question (\"has this
   counterparty ever taken a subsidy?\") is exactly the one this cannot answer;
   the answer lives in per-programme 採択者一覧 published as scattered
   spreadsheets by each ministry. Recording the boundary here keeps a future
   reader from assuming the join exists because the datasets sit side by side.

   ## Coverage is a union of keyword queries, not an enumeration

   The API requires a `keyword` of at least 2 characters and has no \"all\"
   mode (measured: an empty keyword is HTTP 400). So coverage is whatever the
   keyword set finds, and the manifest records the keywords used — a catalogue
   that did not say how it was gathered would read as complete.
