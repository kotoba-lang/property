  "Select a bounded slice of the GLEIF corpus for the workspace query plane.

   Why a projection exists at all: the corpus is 3.4M legal entities. Measured
   on this workspace's DataScript loader, 200k entities cost 85 s and 614 MB
   and 600k cost 290 s and 1.2 GB, so the full universe is ~30 min of load and
   ~6 GB resident — a cost the plane cannot pay on every CLI query. The
   corpus stays whole and authoritative on disk; the plane loads the slice a
   given question needs.

   What that costs, stated plainly (CLAUDE.md, kotobase one-ref rule): an LEI
   outside the loaded slice does NOT join to market-intel, cloud-itonami-lei,
   or property ownership in Datalog. It is answerable only by a scan of the
   corpus (`scripts/query_gleif_corpus.cljs`), which cannot join. Widening the
   join surface means widening the projection, not sharding it further."

(defn matcher
  "Predicate over corpus records built from a selection spec.

   `:leis`          — explicit LEI allowlist (the join-driven default)
   `:jurisdictions` — ISO 3166 codes, prefix-matched so \"US\" also takes
                      \"US-DE\" (GLEIF files US entities under both)
   `:status`        — `Registration.RegistrationStatus`, e.g. \"ISSUED\"

   With no criteria the matcher takes everything: a projector invoked with no
   filter should produce the whole corpus, not silently produce nothing."
