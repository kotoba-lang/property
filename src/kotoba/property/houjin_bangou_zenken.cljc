(ns kotoba.property.houjin-bangou-zenken
  "Portable parsing/normalisation for the National Tax Agency 法人番号 (Corporate
   Number) 全件データ (zenken) CSV — every corporate entity Japan has issued a
   number to, published monthly by 国税庁法人番号公表サイト.

   Kept free of I/O so the row contract can be tested without a 266 MB
   download: `scripts/collect_houjin_bangou_zenken.cljs` owns the streaming and
   this namespace owns the meaning of a row. Same split as
   `kotoba.property.gleif-golden-copy`.

   ## Why the bulk file and not the Web-API

   `cloud-itonami-isic-8291`'s `dossier.houjin-bangou` is a real client for
   https://api.houjin-bangou.nta.go.jp — a *lookup* path: one company you
   already have a name or a number for, and it needs an Application ID the
   National Tax Agency issues to a named operator over ~2-4 weeks. The 全件
   download is the *ingest* path: the same authority, the same three basic
   facts (商号・所在地・法人番号), no account, no Application ID, one POST.
   Neither replaces the other, and this namespace is only about the second.

   ## Emitted attributes

   Deliberately the names the workspace query plane already joins on
   (ADR-2607252000). Two of them matter most:

   - `:company/houjin-bangou` — the 13-digit number, unambiguous.
   - `:company/registration-no` — the *same* value, because that is the
     attribute GLEIF's Golden Copy already carries for JP entities
     (`Entity.RegistrationAuthority.RegistrationAuthorityEntityID`). Emitting
     both means a GLEIF record and an NTA record unify without a translation
     layer, while `:company/houjin-bangou` stays available for queries that
     must not risk a collision with another jurisdiction's registry number.

   `dossier`'s canonical entity id is `jpn-<corporateNumber>`
   (ADR-2607182200); it is `(str \"jpn-\" (:company/houjin-bangou rec))` and is
   deliberately not stored — a derived value in a 5.8M-record corpus is 5.8M
   copies of a `str` call.

   ## Corpus shape

   Line 1 is a manifest map carrying the provenance constant for the whole file
   (authority, licence, publish, source hash); every later line is one entity.
   Same reason as GLEIF: repeating five constant values on millions of records
   costs hundreds of MB for information that cannot vary within a file.
