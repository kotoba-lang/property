  "Tally the GLEIF LEI2 universe: the denominator of \"how many legal entities
   are there\", as GLEIF's Golden Copy actually reports it.

   Why this is a separate namespace from `gleif-projection`: a projection is a
   *slice* chosen for the query plane (`gleif-lei-joined` is 18,930 companies —
   the LEIs the plane already references), and reading a slice's record count as
   a universe count is the single mistake this namespace exists to prevent. A
   tally never selects; it walks every record and reports how many it walked.

   Kept free of I/O so the counting contract is testable without a 500 MB
   download: `scripts/tally_gleif_universe.cljs` owns the streaming, this owns
   the arithmetic.

   Three distinctions the shape enforces, because collapsing any of them turns
   a measurement into a guess:

   1. **A record existing is not a registration being alive.** GLEIF keeps
      LAPSED, RETIRED, ANNULLED and MERGED rows in the Golden Copy. `:by-status`
      is reported in full and never summed into one \"companies\" number.
   2. **Absent is not zero.** The collector drops blank cells, so a record with
      no jurisdiction has no `:company/jurisdiction` key at all. Those land in
      an explicit `:absent` counter, never in a bucket and never silently
      dropped from the denominator.
   3. **Unreadable is not measured.** `:tally/unreadable` counts lines that
      could not be parsed. A caller that reports a tally without reading it is
      reporting a number it did not measure."
