   全件データ (the invoice registry: every business registered to issue a
   qualified invoice under Japan's consumption-tax regime).

   ## Why this sits next to 法人番号 and not somewhere else

   A **corporation's** registration number is `T` + its 13-digit 法人番号, so for
   a company this is not a second identity — it is an *attribute* of the one it
   already has, and it answers a question the 法人番号 registry cannot: is this
   counterparty a 課税事業者 (and since when, and is the registration still
   live). It joins on `:company/houjin-bangou` with no translation.

   ## Sole proprietors are the reason this namespace has a kind guard

   An **individual's** registration number is *not* a 法人番号 — it is a number
   issued to a natural person, published alongside their name (and, where they
   asked for it, their trading name and address). That is natural-person data.
   `projectable?` says no for those rows, and the projector refuses to write
   them, so the rule is enforced by code rather than by a paragraph in
   DATA-GOVERNANCE.md that a future ingest might not read.

   That is also why 個人 rows can still be *collected* to a node-local corpus:
   answering \"is this one business registered\" for a named counterparty is a
   lookup, and a lookup does not require publishing a person-indexed dataset.
